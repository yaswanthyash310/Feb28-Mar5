Assignment 1: -> Create a page, have a toggle button. On this button, if I click once, show the popup, inside the popup have the close button.
 -> I should be able to do it again and again without refresh.

Assignment 2: -> You have 2 variable. Both of them are number. var a = 10; var b = 20; -> Your task is to swap these variable. (Your logic here). YOU CANNOT USE ANY OTHER VARIABLE. --> a; 20 --> b; 10

Even if you display in console, it's okay.
